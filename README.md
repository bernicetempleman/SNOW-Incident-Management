# SNOW-Incident-Management

Any disruption to the service is referred to an Incident.

The goal of Incident Management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible following an incident, while minimizing impact to business operations and ensuring quality is maintained.


The Service-Now platform supports the Incident Management process with capabilities to record incidents, classify according to impact and urgency, assign to appropriate groups, escalate, and manage through to resolution and reporting.

## Process
1. LOGGING - By default any user can log an incident. There are a number of ways to log an incident:
	Employee Self Service Portal
	Standard UI


2. CATEGORIZATION - Incident forms have fields for category and subcategory, which allow for easy classification of incidents. These categories can be used by the system to create automatic assignment rules or notifications.

## 3. PRIORITIZATION: 
SNOW uses three metrics for determining the order in which incidents are processed. 

All three are supported by incident forms: 
- Impact: The effect on business that an incident has. 
- Urgency: The extent to which the incident's resolution can bear delay. 
- Priority: How quickly the service desk should address the incident.

Priority is generated from Impact and Urgency according to the following table:![image]

4. RESOLUTION: Once the incident is considered Resolved, the incident state should be set by the service desk as resolved. 
After a sufficient period of time has passed, assuming that the user that opened the incident is satisfied, the incident state may be set to closed. 


5. CLOSURE: Closed incidents will be filtered out of view, but will remain in the system for reference purposes. Closed incidents can be reopened if the user or service desk believe that it needs to be reopened.

It is also possible to generate customer satisfaction surveys upon closure of incidents. This allows the service desk to gather information about their quality of service directly from the user.
